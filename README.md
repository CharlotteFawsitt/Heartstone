This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `Hearthstone Card Viewer`

This is a React app that allows users to search for Hearthstone cards and view them. When a user clicks on the card it will show the card on its own with some information below it. Then image is changed to the gold version of the card.
There is also a section that allows users to view the backs of the cards. Again when clicking on the card back it will show the animated version of the card.

Here is a link to where the web app is hosted on firebase: https://hearthstone-card-viewer.firebaseapp.com/
